**TL;DR**: On-behalf-of auth is great because it allows our app to make calls to services on the user's behalf. In Azure Container Apps with Easy Auth, getting the necessary `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ID-TOKEN` header requires just a few tweaks to `authConfigs`. With this we can create an `OnBehalfOfCredential`.

Some time ago, [John Reilly](https://johnnyreilly.com/) wrote about [getting .NET authentication to work nicely with Easy Auth](https://johnnyreilly.com/azure-container-apps-easy-auth-and-dotnet-authentication). He mentioned the lack of token support at the time, _"If there was a populated `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ACCESS-TOKEN` then it would unlock all manner of possibilities. Let's say I want to make use of the Graph API on behalf of my logged in user. I cannot."_ 

Using more recent API versions though, we can set `authConfigs` in such a way to give us a [token store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/token-store) and grant us the `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ID-TOKEN` header in each request!

## The bits you need to make it work (a minimal example)

In addition to your existing config inside the [`containerApps/authConfigs`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.app/containerapps/authconfigs?pivots=deployment-language-bicep) bicep template, we need the `login` and `validation` objects set inside the identity provider (`azureActiveDirectory` in this example, but similar config could work with certain other identity providers):

```bicep
      azureActiveDirectory: {
        enabled: true
        registration: {
          // your existing config
        }
        login: {
          loginParameters: [ 'scope=api://your-ad-app-id-uri/.default openid profile' ]
        }
        validation: {
          allowedAudiences: [
            'api://your-ad-app-id-uri'
          ]
          defaultAuthorizationPolicy: {
            allowedApplications: []
          }
        }
      }
```

 And importantly, we need the `login` object at the root â€“ this is where we will configure the token store:

```bicep
login: {
  // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/token-store
  tokenStore: {
    enabled: true
    azureBlobStorage: {
      blobContainerUri: 'https://${your-storage-account-name}.blob.${environment().suffixes.storage}/name-of-the-your-blob-container-for-the-token-store'
      managedIdentityResourceId: 'managed-identity-id-of-your-container-app'
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to use the Azure CLI:

```bash
az containerapp auth update \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --sas-url-secret-nameÂ <SAS_SECRET_NAME> \
  --token-store true
```

Now, in addition to `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL`, we get the `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ID-TOKEN`! This is great because it allows our app to create on-behalf-of credentials to represent the user to other services that are called from our app. Say we want to call Graph on behalf of the user (from the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers?tabs=csharp#on-behalf-of-provider)):

```csharp
var scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

// Multi-tenant apps can use "common",
// single-tenant apps must use the tenant ID from the Azure portal
var tenantId = "common";

// Values from app registration
var clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
var clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";

// using Azure.Identity;
var options = new OnBehalfOfCredentialOption
{
    AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud,
};

// This is the incoming token to exchange using on-behalf-of flow
var oboToken = "JWT_TOKEN_TO_EXCHANGE";

var onBehalfOfCredential = new OnBehalfOfCredential(
    tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, oboToken, options);

var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(onBehalfOfCredential, scopes);
```

And there you have it ðŸ˜Š
